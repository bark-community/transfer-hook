# Solana Transfer Hooks

Welcome to the Solana Transfer-Hooks repository! This repository contains information about Solana's Transfer Hook extension and Transfer Hook Interface, offering powerful functionalities for the creation of Mint Accounts with custom instruction logic. These features unlock various use cases related to token transfers, such as enforcing NFT royalties and implementing black or white lists for wallets that can receive tokens.

## Functionalities

### 1. Mint Accounts with Custom Instruction Logic

- Mint Accounts play a crucial role in the creation and management of tokens on the Solana blockchain.
- The Transfer Hook extension introduces the ability to add custom instruction logic to these Mint Accounts, empowering developers to define unique behaviors or actions to be executed on every token transfer involving these accounts.

### 2. Use Cases

#### Enforcing NFT Royalties

- The custom instruction logic can be specifically crafted to enforce royalty payments on transfers of non-fungible tokens (NFTs). This functionality is particularly relevant in digital art and collectibles, where creators often receive a percentage of sales each time their NFT is transferred to a new owner.

#### Black or White List for Wallets

- The Transfer Hook Interface enables the implementation of security features, such as blacklisting or whitelisting specific wallet addresses. This functionality is valuable for compliance purposes, allowing developers to restrict transfers to or from certain addresses based on predefined criteria.

## Usage

After installing the dependencies using `npm install`, you can perform the following tasks:

1. Build: `anchor build`
   - Execute this command to build the Solana program associated with the Transfer Hooks.

2. Deploy: `anchor deploy`
   - Use this command to deploy the Transfer Hooks to the Solana blockchain.

3. Test: `anchor test`
   - Run this command to execute tests and ensure the proper functioning of the Transfer Hooks.
